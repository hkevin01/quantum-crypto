# Quantum Crypto Cryptography

## Purpose
This project provides educational demos and interactive tools for understanding quantum cryptography, post-quantum cryptography, and the impact of quantum computing on modern cryptosystems. It is designed for students, researchers, and security professionals interested in the intersection of quantum computing and cryptography.

## Scope
- **Quantum cryptography algorithms** (e.g., Shor’s Algorithm)
- **Classical cryptosystems vulnerable to quantum attacks** (e.g., ECDSA, RSA)
- **Post-quantum cryptography** (lattice-based, hash-based, etc.)
- **Interactive demos and visualizations**
- **References and further reading**
