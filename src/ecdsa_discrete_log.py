# ECDSA/Discrete Log Problem Explanation
EXPLANATION = (
    "ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. "
    "Quantum computers running Shor's Algorithm can efficiently solve the discrete log problem, making ECDSA insecure in a post-quantum world. "
    "This section will include a demo and visualization in the future."
