# Post-Quantum Crypto Explanation
EXPLANATION = (
    "Post-quantum cryptography includes cryptosystems believed to be secure against quantum attacks. "
    "Popular approaches include hash-based signatures and lattice-based encryption. "
    "This section will provide demos and visualizations for these schemes."
)

HASH_BASED_EXPLANATION = (
    "Hash-based cryptography uses hash functions to build secure digital signatures. "
    "Examples: XMSS, SPHINCS+."
)

LATTICE_BASED_EXPLANATION = (
    "Lattice-based cryptography relies on the hardness of lattice problems. "
    "Examples: NTRU, Kyber, Dilithium."
)
