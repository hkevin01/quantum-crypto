# Post-Quantum Cryptography Overview

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) refers to cryptographic algorithms believed to be secure against quantum attacks. These include:

- **Hash-based cryptography**: Uses hash functions for digital signatures (e.g., XMSS, SPHINCS+).
- **Lattice-based cryptography**: Relies on hard lattice problems (e.g., NTRU, Kyber, Dilithium).
- **Code-based, multivariate, and isogeny-based**: Other approaches under study.

## Why PQC?
Quantum computers running Shor's Algorithm can break RSA, ECDSA, and other widely used schemes. PQC aims to provide alternatives that remain secure.

## NIST PQC Standardization
NIST is standardizing PQC algorithms for future use. See [NIST PQC Project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) for details.
