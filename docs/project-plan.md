# Project Plan: Quantum Crypto Cryptography

## Overview
This project aims to provide educational demos and interactive tools for quantum and post-quantum cryptography, targeting students, researchers, and security professionals.

## Phases & Milestones

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Scaffold project structure
- [x] Set up README, requirements, and initial GUI skeleton
- [ ] Establish documentation and scripts folders
- [ ] Set up GitHub workflows and .copilot configuration

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Shorâ€™s Algorithm demo (explanation, code, visualization)
- [ ] ECDSA/Discrete Log Problem (explanation, vulnerability demo)
- [ ] Post-Quantum Crypto (hash-based, lattice-based, etc.)
- [ ] Interactive Demos (run, visualize, compare)

### Phase 3: Documentation & Usability
- [ ] Expand README with usage examples
- [ ] Add in-depth docs for each cryptosystem
- [ ] Create Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step cryptanalysis
- [ ] Add references and further reading

### Phase 4: Community & Collaboration
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Engage with the crypto and quantum communities

## Task Breakdown
- Design and implement GUI tabs for each section
- Integrate Qiskit for quantum demos
- Implement cryptographic algorithms and visualizations
- Write clear, accessible documentation
- Test across platforms

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Project setup, initial demos
- **Week 2-3:** Core cryptosystem implementations
- **Week 4:** Documentation, polish, and community setup
